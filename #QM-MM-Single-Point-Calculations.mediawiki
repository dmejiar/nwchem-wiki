{{Template:QMMM_Single_Point_Calculations}}
The task directive for QM/MM single point energy and gradient calculations is given by
 task qmmm <qmtheory> energy
or
 task qmmm <qmtheory> gradient [numerical]
where qmtheory refers to the level of QM theory (e.g. dft, tce, mp2, ...). 

The ground state QM/MM energy calculations should be possible with
all QM descriptions available in NWChem, however most of testing was performed using core QM methods (scf,dft,mp2,tce). The ground state QM/MM gradient
calculations can be performed analytically with scf,dft,mp2 levels of theory and numerically for all the others.


The relevant settings for QM/MM interface block for energy and gradient calculations
include 
*[[qmmm_bq_zone    |bqzone]]
*[[qmmm_mm_charges |mm_charges]]
*[[qmmm_link_atoms |link_atoms]]
*[[qmmm_link_ecp   |link_ecp]].
