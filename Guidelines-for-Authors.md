# **TO BE REVISED. MOST OF THE CONTENT HERE IS OBSOLETE**

The current wiki has
been created to provide documentation related to NWChem \[1\]. This
includes the user manual, tutorials and common practices, as well as
programmer references, as well as other useful information. In order to
make this wiki as useful as possible to the NWChem community a certain
level of consistency of style is useful. To asist with this and beause
of the nature of the subject matter of this specific wiki a number of
tools and extensions have been selected to help document relevant
aspects. These tools and suggestions for their use will be discussed
here as well. Obviously for general information on these tools external
references will be used.

## Tools

This wiki has a number of extensions installed to facilitate the
documentation process for which it is intended. The configuration of the
wiki installation can found at
[Special:Version](Special:Version). For the purpose of this
wiki there are a number of aspects that are relevant. These include
[Links](#Links),
[Equations](#Equations),
[Citations](#Citations), and
[Images](#Images).

### Links

Links are an essential tool for integrating information from various
sources. The wiki therefore supports a wide variety of links that can be
used and details on how to used them can be found at [Links,
URLs](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Advanced_editing#Links.2C_URLs).
For general use there are a few types of links that are clearly
important. These links include

  - intra wiki links to other pages
  - intra wiki links to sections of pages
  - external links

Below a few simple examples can be found. However, before links are
discussed a few comments on how the wiki handles anchors are in order so
that there is a construct to link to.

#### Anchors on wiki pages

Anchors are points on the wiki pages that you can link to. Anchors are
either automatically generated by the wiki but can also be created
manually.

The wiki automatically creates anchors for all pages and all headers on
each page. This means that you can link to every page and every section
or subsection on every page in any case.

In cases where the automatically generated anchors do not provide for
the right points to link to anchors can be created manually. In HTML one
would use a construct such as \<a name="link here"\>text\</a\>. However,
the wiki does not allow the use of the \<a\> tag. Instead, the "id" HTML
attribute can be used with a number of tags to the same effect. Examples
of this are:

` `  
`  <div id="link here">text</div>`  
`  <div id="link here"/>`  
`  <span id="link here">text</span>`  
`  `

Occasionally manually entered anchors are also needed where one would
expect automatically generated anchors to work. For example, the
automatically generated anchor for the subsection entitled "Dyall's
Modified Dirac Hamiltonian approximation" cannot be linked to as the
apostrophe character cannot be used in a link. In this case adding an
anchor manually for the title allows the subsection to be linked
successfully. To see this compare the examples
below:

`  `  
`   [[Relativistic-All-electron-Approximations#Dyall's Modified Dirac-Hamiltonian approximation]]`  
`   [[Relativistic-All-electron-Approximations#Dyall-Mod-Dirac-Hamiltonian]]`  
`   `

`  `[`Relativistic-All-electron-Approximations#Dyall's`` ``Modified``
``Dirac-Hamiltonian``
``approximation`](Relativistic-All-electron-Approximations#Dyall's_Modified_Dirac-Hamiltonian_approximation)  
`  `[`Relativistic-All-electron-Approximations#Dyall-Mod-Dirac-Hamiltonian`](Relativistic-All-electron-Approximations#Dyall-Mod-Dirac-Hamiltonian)

#### Intra wiki links to other pages

Links to other pages are generated by placing the page title between
double square brackets.

` `  
`  [[Getting Started]]`  
`  [[ECP|Effective Core Potentials]]`  
`  `

becomes

` `[`Getting`` ``Started`](Getting-Started)  
` `[`Effective`` ``Core`` ``Potentials`](ECP)

Note that spaces in the specified page name are automatically replaced
by underscores to generate the correct link. In addition the "|"
character may be used to specify a label for the link.



#### Pictures

There are a variety of situations where the best way to show something
is to provide a picture. In order to do this the image file has to be
uploaded (see the [Upload](Special:Upload) page) to the wiki
server. Next a link on the wiki page to the image file has be included.
In order to avoid trampling over previously uploaded image files it is
recommended to check the list of previously uploaded files at the
[ListFiles](Special:ListFiles) page.

As an example the (old) NWChem logo image is used. First the picture was
included on with wiki page using

` `  
`  [[file:Nwchem_logo_dark.png|NWChem logo]]`  
`  `

to give

` `[`NWChem`` ``logo`](file:Nwchem_logo_dark.png)

Alternatively the construct

` `  
`  [[media:Nwchem_logo_dark.png]]`  
`  `

gives

` `[`media:Nwchem_logo_dark.png`](media:Nwchem_logo_dark.png)

## Movies

The effort to add movies to the Wiki pages is under development.
