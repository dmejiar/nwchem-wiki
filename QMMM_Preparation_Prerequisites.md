The necessary prerequisites for
the preparation of topology and restart files for QM/MM simulations are:
*Properly [http://www.wwpdb.org/docs.html formatted PDB file] for the system.
*Fragment Files (extension .frg)
*Parameter Files (extension .par)

A number of fragment files as well as standard Amber type force parameter files are provided with the NWChem distribution. However, user should be prepared
to generate additional fragment and [parameter files](./Parameter-file.pdf) for nonstandard cases
