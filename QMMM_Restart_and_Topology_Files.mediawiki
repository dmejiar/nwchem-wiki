The structure of the system in QM/MM calculations is provided by the restart file (extension .rst) 
and not by the geometry block as it would be for pure QM calculations.
The parameters of classical interaction are given by the topology file (extension .top). These two files are '''REQUIRED''' for QM/MM calculations and can be generated  by the [[Prepare|Prepare]]. In a typical setting this "preparation stage" is performed separately from the main QM/MM simulation.
