QM/MM transition states calculations for qm or qmlink regions can be performed using 
 task qmmm <qmtheory> saddle
The overall algorithm is very similar to QM/MM optimization calculations, but instead of optimization, transition state search will be performed
for [[Qmmm_region#qm|qm]] or [[Qmmm_region#qmlink|qmlink]] region for specified number of steps ( as defined by [[qmmm_maxiter|maxiter]] keyword). The remaining classical regions (if any) will be optimized
following the standard optimization protocol, which may involve, if specified, ESP charge representation of the QM atoms (a recommended option).

The success transition state calculations
is strongly dependent on the initial guess. User may consider generation of the latter using QM/MM reaction pathway calculation.
Another useful strategy involves precalculation of the Hessian. Following the example presented above one could have precalculated numerical
Hessian for the qm region
 ...
 qmmm
 region qm
 end
 
 freq
 animate
 end
 
 task qmmm dft freq

and then used this information in the TS calculation
 ...
 driver
  clear
  inhess 2  #read in hessian from perm directory
  moddir 1  #follow 1st mode
 end

  bqzone 15.0
